# TaxE (Taxonomy of Ecosystems)

Use GO terms/Interpro accessions to discern a taxonomy of ecosystems 
from EBI Metagenomics. Also predict biomes from gene frequency.

# Gene Ontology (GO)

wget http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go/go-basic.obo

Several programs need access to the Gene Ontology "edit" file located 
in their Github repo. Clone the repo into a directory parallel to "tax-e"
to put it in the default expected location:

git clone https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology.git
